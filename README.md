# requirement-analysis
This repository documents the process and importance of requirement analysis in software development, using a booking management system as a case study.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of defining, documenting, and maintaining requirements in the engineering design process. It is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where business requirements are translated into detailed technical specifications.

Key aspects include:
- Identifying stakeholders' needs
- Defining system functionality
- Establishing constraints
- Creating models and prototypes
- Validating requirements

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

1. **Reduces Project Risks**: Proper analysis helps identify potential issues early, saving time and resources.
2. **Improves Communication**: Creates a common understanding between stakeholders and developers.
3. **Ensures Quality**: Clear requirements lead to better system design and implementation.
4. **Cost Efficiency**: Changes in requirements are more expensive to implement in later stages.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

- **Requirement Gathering**: Collecting requirements from stakeholders through interviews, surveys, and workshops.
- **Requirement Elicitation**: Extracting implicit requirements through observation and prototyping.
- **Requirement Documentation**: Creating clear, unambiguous requirement specifications (SRS documents).
- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**: Using diagrams (UML, flowcharts) to visualize requirements.
- **Requirement Validation**: Ensuring requirements are complete, consistent, and feasible.

## Types of Requirements

### Functional Requirements
These define what the system should do:
- Users can search for available properties by date and location
- Users can view property details (images, amenities, pricing)
- Users can book properties and receive confirmation emails
- Admin can manage property listings and user accounts

### Non-functional Requirements
These define how the system should perform:
- The system should handle 1000 concurrent users
- Page load time should be under 2 seconds
- The system must be available 99.9% of the time
- All user data must be encrypted in transit and at rest

## Use Case Diagrams

Use Case Diagrams visualize interactions between actors (users/systems) and the system's functionality. They help:
- Identify system boundaries
- Show relationships between use cases and actors
- Provide a high-level view of system functionality

## Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance Criteria define the conditions that must be met for a feature to be considered complete. For the Checkout feature:

1. **Payment Processing**:
   - System accepts valid credit card details (16 digits, future expiry date, correct CVV)
   - Displays payment confirmation upon successful transaction
   - Sends booking confirmation email with all details

2. **Validation**:
   - Prevents checkout if required fields are missing
   - Validates date conflicts before confirming booking
   - Shows appropriate error messages for invalid inputs

3. **User Experience**:
   - Progress indicators show checkout steps
   - Option to save payment details for future use
   - Clear summary of booking details before confirmation
